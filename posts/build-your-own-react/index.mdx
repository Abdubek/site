We are going to rewrite React from scratch. Step by step. Following the architecture from the real React code but without all the optimizations and non-essential features.

This is the third time I'm building a mini-react. The first one was before React v16. Second one was after React v16, when the Fiber architecture was introduced. And the third one, this one, is based on v16.8: the one with hooks.

You can find the history with all the blog posts and code on the [Didact repo](https://github.com/pomber/didact). There's also a [talk covering the same content](https://youtu.be/8Kc2REHdwnQ).

But this post is self-contained. Starting from scratch, these are all the things we'll add to our version of React one by one:

- **Step I**: The `createElement` Function
- **Step II**: The `render` Function
- **Step III**: Concurrent Mode
- **Step IV**: Fibers
- **Step V**: Render and Commit Phases
- **Step VI**: Reconciliation
- **Step VII**: Function Components
- **Step VIII**: Hooks

We'll write around 300 lines of code. Don't expect to finish this post in 10 minutes. It will take some time, but it will worth it. You can stop between steps and come back later.

<CodeWave>

```jsx
const element = <h1 title="foo">Hello</h1>
const container = document.getElementById("root")
ReactDOM.render(element, container)
```

### Step Zero: Review

But first let's review some basic concepts. You can skip this step if you already have a good idea of how React, JSX, elements and DOM mutations work.

We'll use this React app, just three lines of code. The first one defines a React element. The next one gets a node from the DOM. The last one renders the React element into the container.

**Let's remove all the React specific code and replace it with vanilla JavaScript**.

```jsx 1
const element = <h1 title="foo">Hello</h1>
const container = document.getElementById("root")
ReactDOM.render(element, container)
```

On the first line we have the element, defined with JSX. It isn't even valid JavaScript, so to replace it with vanilla JS, first we need to replace it with valid JS.

JSX is transformed to JS by build tools like Babel. But the transformation is usually simple: **replace the code inside the tags with a call to `createElement`, passing the tag name, the props and the children as parameters**.

```jsx
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { title: "foo" },
  "Hello"
)

const container = document.getElementById("root")
ReactDOM.render(element, container)
```

`React.createElement` creates an object from its arguments. Besides some validations, that's all it does. So we can safely **replace the function call with its output**.

```jsx
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")
ReactDOM.render(element, container)
```

And this is what an element is, an object with two properties: `type` and `props` (well, it can have more, but we only care about these two).

The `type` is a string that specifies the type of the dom node we want to create, it's the `tagName` you pass to `document.createElement` when you want to create an HTML element. It can also be a function, but we'll leave that for Step VII.

`props` is another object, it has all the keys and values from the JSX attributes. It also has a special property: `children`.

`children` in this case is a string, but it's usually an array with more elements. That's why elements are also trees.

```jsx 10
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")
ReactDOM.render(element, container)
```

The other piece of React code we need to replace is the call to `ReactDOM.render`.

`render` is where React changes the dom, so let's do the updates ourselves.

```jsx 1,2,4,7,11,12
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")

const node = document.createElement(element.type)
node["title"] = element.props.title

const text = document.createTextNode("")
text["nodeValue"] = element.props.children

node.appendChild(text)
container.appendChild(node)
```

First we create a node using the element `type`, in this case `h1`.

Then we assign all the element `props` to that node. Here it's just the title.

_To avoid confusions, I'll use "element" to refer to React elements and "node" for DOM elements._

```js 1,5,7,14,15
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")

const node = document.createElement(element.type)
node["title"] = element.props.title

const text = document.createTextNode("")
text["nodeValue"] = element.props.children

node.appendChild(text)
container.appendChild(node)
```

Then we create the nodes for the children. We only have a string as a child so we create a text node.

Using `textNode` instead of setting `innerText` will allow us to treat all elements in the same way later. Note also how we set the `nodeValue` like we did it with the `h1` title, it's almost as if the string had `props: {nodeValue: "hello"}`, right?

```js 9,17,18
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")

const node = document.createElement(element.type)
node["title"] = element.props.title

const text = document.createTextNode("")
text["nodeValue"] = element.props.children

node.appendChild(text)
container.appendChild(node)
```

Finally, we append the `textNode` to the `h1` and the `h1` to the `container`.

```js 1:18
const element = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    title: "foo",
    children: "Hello",
  },
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")

const node = document.createElement(element.type)
node["title"] = element.props.title

const text = document.createTextNode("")
text["nodeValue"] = element.props.children

node.appendChild(text)
container.appendChild(node)
```

And now we have the same app as before, but without using React.

</CodeWave>

We turned a simple app from 3 lines of code to 18. 18 lines of code that only work for this specific app.

Let's start again with another app. This time we'll replace React code with our own version of React.

<CodeWave>

```jsx file=./00.jsx
```

### Step I: The `createElement` Function

We'll start by writing our own `createElement`. Let's transform the JSX to JS so we can see the `createElement` calls.

```jsx file=./01.jsx
```

As we saw in the previous step, an element is an object with `type` and `props`. The only thing that our function needs to do is create that object.

```jsx file=./02.jsx
```

We use the _spread operator_ for the `props` and the _rest parameter syntax_ for the `children`, this way the `children` prop will allways be an array.

<div>

For example, `createElement("div")` returns:

```json
{
  "type": "div",
  "props": { "children": [] }
}
```

`createElement("div", null, a)` returns:

```json
{
  "type": "div",
  "props": { "children": [a] }
}
```

and `createElement("div", null, a, b)` returns:

```json
{
  "type": "div",
  "props": { "children": [a, b] }
}
```

</div>

```jsx file=./03.jsx
```

The `children` array could also contain primitive values like strings or numbers. So we'll wrap everything that isn't an object inside its own element and create a special type for them: `TEXT_ELEMENT`.

_React doesn't wrap primitive values or create empty arrays when there aren't `children`, but we do it because it will simplify our code, and for our library we prefer simple code than performant code._

```jsx file=./03.jsx  25,28,29,30
```

We have the `createElement` function but we are still using React here.

In order to replace it let's give a name to our library. We need a name that sounds like React but also makes it clear that it has a _didactic_ purpose.

```jsx file=./04.jsx
```

We'll call it Didact.

But we still want to use JSX here. How do we tell babel to use Didact's `createElement` instead of React's? A comment.

```jsx file=./05.jsx
```

If we have a comment like this one in our file, when babel transpiles the JSX it will use the function that we want.

```jsx file=./05.jsx 37
```

### Step II: The `render` Function

Next, we need to write our version of the `ReactDOM.render` function.

```jsx file=./06.jsx 25:27,29,31,32,42
```

For now, we only care about adding stuff to the DOM. We'll handle updating and deleting later.

```jsx file=./07.jsx
```

We start by creating the dom node using the element type. And then append the new node to the container.

```jsx file=./08.jsx
```

We recursively do the same for each child.

```jsx file=./09.jsx
```

We also need to handle text elements, if the element type is `TEXT_ELEMENT` we create a textnode instead of a regular node.

```jsx file=./10.jsx
```

The last thing we need to do here is assign the element props to the node.

```jsx file=./10.jsx 1:58
```

And that's it. We now have a library that can render JSX to the DOM.

</CodeWave>

### Step III: Concurrent Mode

But... before we start adding more code we need a refactor.

<CodeWave>

```jsx file=./10.jsx 25,38:40,43
```

There's a problem with this recursive call.

Once we start rendering, we won't stop until we rendered all the element tree.
If the element tree is big, it may block the main thread for too long. And if the browser needs to do high priority stuff like handling user input or keeping an animation smooth, it will have to wait until the render finishes.

```jsx file=./11.jsx
```

So what we are going to do is break the work into small units,
and after we finish each unit
we'll let the browser interrupt the rendering if there's anything else that needs to be done.

```jsx file=./11.jsx 47,55,56,58
```

We use `requestIdleCallback` to make a loop.
You can think of `requestIdleCallback` as a `setTimeout`, but instead of us telling it when to run, the browser will run tha callback when the main thread is free.

```jsx file=./11.jsx 47,48,49,53,54,56
```

Also, it gives us a deadline parameter
We can use it to check how much time we have until the browser needs to take control again.

Small disclaimer here,
the concurrent mode is still unstable in the last version of React,
so unless you explicitly opt-in,
it will still use a while loop like this one
but without checking if it should yield to the browser
End of the disclaimer

```jsx file=./11.jsx 47,50:52,56,60:62
```

What we need to do now, is write a performUnitOfWork function that not only perform the work but also choose the next thing to work on.

Edit -> three things:

- set the first uow
- perform it
- choose the next one

</CodeWave>

### Step IV: Fibers

And for that we need a data structure: a fiber tree.
Fibers are going to be the units of work, they are just javascript objects, and we will have one for each element in the element tree

Let's see how the fiber tree will look like with an example.

We will create the first unit of work in the render function, this will be the root of the fiber tree.
The rest of the work will happen in the performUnitOfWork function. Let's see how it works.

<ImageWave>

![Fiber Tree 0](./fiber0.png)

Suppose we want to render an element tree like this one:

```jsx
Didact.render(
  <div>
    <h1>
      <p />
      <a />
    </h1>
    <h2 />
  </div>,
  container
)
```

In the `render` we'll create the root fiber and set it as the `nextUnitOfWork`. The rest of the work will happen on the `performUnitOfWork` function, there we will do three things for each fiber:

1. add the element to the dom
2. create the fibers for the element's children
3. select the next unit of work

![Fiber Tree 1](./fiber1.png)

One of the goals of this data structure is to make it easy to find the next unit of work. That's why each fiber has a link to its first child, its next sibling and its parent.

![Fiber Tree 2](./fiber2.png)

When we finish performing work on a fiber, if it has a `child` that fiber will be the next unit of work.

From our example, when we finish working on the `div` fiber the next unit of work will be the `h1` fiber.

![Fiber Tree 3](./fiber3.png)

If the fiber doesn't have a `child`, we use the `sibling` as the next unit of work.

For example, the `p` fiber doesn't have a `child` so we move to the `a` fiber after finishing it.

![Fiber Tree 4](./fiber4.png)

And if the fiber doesn't have a `child` nor a `sibling` we go to the "uncle": the `sibling` of the `parent`. Like `a` and `h2` fibers from the example.

Also, if the `parent` doesn't have a `sibling`, we keep going up through the `parent`s until we find one with a `sibling` or until we reach the root. If we reached the root, it means we finished performing all the work for this `render`.

</ImageWave>

Now let's put it into code

<CodeWave>

```jsx file=./11.jsx 25:45
```

First, let's remove this code from the render function.

```jsx file=./12.jsx 25,39,41:45
```

We keep the part that creates a dom node in its own function, we are going to use it later.

```jsx file=./13.jsx 41:50
```

In the render function we set nextUnitOfWork to the root of the fiber tree

```jsx file=./13.jsx 52,55:57,61,65:69
```

Then, when the browser is ready,
it will call our workLoop and we'll start working on the root

```jsx file=./14.jsx
```

First, we create a new dom node and append it to the dom

```jsx file=./15.jsx
```

Then for each child we create a new fiber

```jsx file=./16.jsx
```

And we add it to the fiber tree setting it either as a child or as a sibling, dependig if it's the first child or not.

```jsx file=./17.jsx
```

Finally we search for the next unit of work.
We first try with the child, then with the sibling, then with the uncle, and so on.

```jsx file=./17.jsx 65:108
```

And that's our `performUnitOfWork`

```jsx file=./17.jsx 65,70:72
```

### Step V: Render and Commit Phases

We have another problem here.

We are adding a new node to the dom each time we work on an element.
And, remember, the browser could interrupt our work before we finish rendering the whole tree.
In that case, the user will see an incomplete UI. And we don't want that.

```jsx file=./18.jsx 41,42,48,50,70[1]
```

So we need to remove the part that mutates the DOM from here.

```jsx file=./18.1.jsx
```

Instead, we'll keep track of the root of the fiber tree.
We call it the work in progress root

```jsx file=./19.jsx 41:43,58,67:69,72
```

and once we finish all the work,
(we know it because there isnt a next unit of work)
we commit the fiber tree to the DOM

```jsx file=./20.jsx 41:54
```

We call the commitRoot function,
And here we recursively append all the nodes to the dom

### Step VI: Reconciliation

So far we only _added_ stuff to the DOM.
but what about updating or deleting nodes?

That's what we are going to do now,
we need to compare the elements we receive on the render function
to the last fiber tree we commited to the DOM.

```jsx file=./21.jsx
```

For that we neeed to save a reference to the root after we finish the commit.
We call it currentRoot.
We also add the "alternate" property to every fiber.
This property is a link to the old fiber,
the fiber that we commited to the DOM in the previous commit phase.

```jsx file=./21.jsx 90:129
```

Remember in performUnitOfWork, the part were we create new fibers?
Let's move it to a new function

```jsx file=./22.jsx 90,95,96,108,110,114[1]
```

We extracted the part that create the new fibers

```jsx file=./22.jsx 110,133
```

Here we will reconcile the old fibers with the new elements

```jsx file=./23.jsx
```

So, inside this while, the two variables that matter are the element and the oldFiber.
the element is the thing we want to render to the dom
and the oldFiber is what we rendered the last time,
how do we compare them?

```jsx file=./24.jsx
```

We use the type
if the old fiber and the new element have the same type, we can keep the dom node and just update it with the new props
if the type is different and there is a new element, it means we need to create a new dom node.
and if the types are different and there is an old fiber, we need to remove the old node

Here React also uses keys, that makes a better reconciliation,
but we are not doing that, we want to keep it simple, or simpler.

```jsx file=./25.jsx
```

Ok, for the case of the update, we can keep the dom node from the old fiber.
And here we are adding a new property, the effectTag, which we we'll use later, on the commit phase.

```jsx file=./26.jsx
```

Then for the case where the element needs a new dom node we tag the new fiber with the PLACEMENT effect tag.

```jsx file=./27.jsx
```

And for the case where we need to delete the node, we don't have a new fiber so we add the effect tag to the old fiber.

But when we commit the fiber tree to the DOM we do it from the work in progress root, which doesn't have the old fibers.

```jsx file=./28.jsx
```

So we need an array to keep track of the nodes we want to remove.

```jsx file=./29.jsx
```

and then when we are commiting the changes to the DOM we also use the fibers from that array

```jsx file=./29.jsx 48:56
```

Now, let's change the commitWork function to handle the new effectTags

```jsx file=./30.jsx
```

If the fiber has a PLACEMENT effect tag we do the same as before, append the dom node to the node from the parent fiber

```jsx file=./31.jsx
```

If it's a DELETION, we do the opposite, remove the child

```jsx file=./32.jsx
```

And if it's an UPDATE, we need to update the existing dom node with the props that changed.

```jsx file=./33.jsx
```

We'll do it in this updateDom function

```jsx file=./34.jsx 36:56
```

We compare the props from the old fiber to the props of the new fiber,
remove the props that are gone, and set the props that are new or changed.

```jsx file=./35.jsx
```

One special kind of prop that we need to update are event listeners, so if the prop name starts with th "on" prefix, we'll handle them differently.

```jsx file=./36.jsx
```

If the event handler changed we remove it from the node.

```jsx file=./37.jsx
```

And then we add the new handler.

```jsx file=./38.jsx
```

### Step VII: Function Components

The next thing we need to add is support for function components.

First let's change the example, we'll use this simple function component, that returns an h1 element.

```jsx file=./39.jsx
```

39

```jsx file=./40.jsx
```

40

```jsx file=./41.jsx
```

41

```jsx file=./42.jsx
```

42

```jsx file=./43.jsx
```

43

```jsx file=./44.jsx
```

44

```jsx file=./45.jsx
```

45

```jsx file=./46.jsx
```

46

```jsx file=./47.jsx
```

47

```jsx file=./48.jsx
```

48

```jsx file=./49.jsx
```

49

```jsx file=./50.jsx
```

50
